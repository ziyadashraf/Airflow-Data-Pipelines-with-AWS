# Data Engineering Pipelines Project

## A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

## I will work with various data sources, such as structured databases, unstructured files, and streaming data sources. The project will require me to transform and clean the data, perform aggregations, and store the processed data in a data warehouse or data lake. I will also learn about data orchestration and scheduling using tools like Apache Airflow.
